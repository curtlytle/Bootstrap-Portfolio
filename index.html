                    <p>I was raised in Pueblo Colorado. I graduated from BYU in 1992 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering
                        with an emphasis in technology. I married my sweetheart in 1988 and have two children</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> My first job out of college was working for Bath Iron Works (BIW), in Maine. BIW built Navy
                        destroyers and
                        I was employed in their IT department writing supporting software for the ship designers. That
                        is how I
                        started my career in the software industry, and have been developing software ever since.
                        Currently my goal
                        is to become a true full stack web developer, where most of my career has been in the Java
                        stack, backend
                        frameworks with JDBC, Hibernate, Servlets and Struts frameworks. My career took a detour by
                        going into the
                        management world. With that my time was more focused on improving my management skills, along
                        with project
                        management, which I tried to incorporate the agile methodologies of Scrum as my style of
                        managment. After 5
                        years in the management arena, I find myself back into the technical world and enjoying the
                        software career
                        again.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I am currently taking the University of Utah full stack bootcamp course to help me quickly get
                        up to speed
                        on the new Javascript frameworks and Javascript itself. In the course, I hope to become a
                        proficient
                        Javascript web developer, learning frameworks like MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS,
                        along with
                        becoming proficient the latest of HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Along with that, my current position is doing all Java, with Swing and Hibernate. I am also
                        getting up to
                        speed with the new Java 8 features and refreshing my skills with the Spring frameworks.</p>
